The first version (V001) of the Level 2 (L2) files for the LBA Tapajos
KM83 Logged Forest site (BR-Sa3) near Santarem, Brazil were posted.
These L2 files cover the period 2000 to 2002 and were derived from
original files furnished by Mike Goulden via a website at the University
of California - Irvine.  Version 1 of the Level 3 and 4 (L3 and L4) files
were also posted on this same date, however, these files are derived from
files provided to Dario Papale by Humberto da Rocha in Brazil.  These L3
and L4 files cover the period 2000 to 2003.  Care should be exercised
by users since the L2, L3, and L4 files came from different sources.

The second version (V002) of the L2 files for the Br-Sa3 site were
posted and cover the period 2000 to 2004.  These latest L2 files are
provided in the AmeriFlux network convention (i.e., standard variable
names and units) consistent with L2 files for other AmeriFlux sites.
These files were provided by Scott Miller through the FLUXNET data
activity at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  Details on the processing
by CDIAC to produce these V002 L2 files are provided at
