                  AmeriFlux Fair-Use Data Agreement

The AmeriFlux data provided on this FTP server are freely available and
were furnished by individual AmeriFlux scientists who encourage their use.
Please kindly inform the appropriate AmeriFlux scientist(s) of how you
intend to use the data and of any publication plans.  It is also important
to contact the AmeriFlux investigator to assure you are downloading
the latest revision of the data and to prevent potential misuse or
misinterpretation of the data.  Please acknowledge the data source
as a citation or in the acknowledgments if no citation is available.
If the AmeriFlux Principal Investigators (PIs) feel that they should
be acknowledged or offered participation as authors, they will let you
know and we assume that an agreement on such matters will be reached
before publishing and/or use of the data for publication.  If your
work directly competes with the PI's analysis they may ask that they
have the opportunity to submit a manuscript before you submit one that
uses unpublished data.  In addition, when publishing, please acknowledge
the agency that supported the research.  Lastly, we kindly request that
those publishing papers using AmeriFlux data provide preprints to the
PIs providing the data and to the data archive at the Carbon Dioxide
Information Analysis Center (CDIAC).
